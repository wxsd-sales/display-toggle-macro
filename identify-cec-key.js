 * 
 * This macro assists you with identifying your display manufactures CEC 
 * Key codes from a Webex Device. For example, the Sharp Aquos Link CEC 
 * protocol accepts the key code 64 to enter standby. The macro will try 
 * each key code between a range you can set. You can then monitor the 
 * displays actions while the code is running. Unfortunately the display
 * status doesn't update immediately from the perspective of the Webex 
 * Device. Therefore it isn't possible to set a target state for the Macro
 * to stop once itâ€™s been reached.
 * 
 * Ensure CEC Mode is set to 'On' for your Webex Devcies Video Output and 
 * that your display has HDMI-CEC enabled as per your manufactures settings.
 * 
 * Mondify the config below with the Video Connector Id, CEC Logical Address
 * and the key code start and stop values (min 0, max 255). Increase the
 * delay between attempts if you are getting no results. A min of 2 seconds
 * has worked well for me in the past.
